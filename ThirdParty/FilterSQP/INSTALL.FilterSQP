1. Getting the source code:

You need to obtain the source files for FilterSQP yourself.  

FilterSQP has been developed by

  Roger Fletcher
       University of Dundee
       http://www.maths.dundee.ac.uk/~fletcher

  Sven Leyffer
       Argonne National Laboratories
       http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~leyffer

and is listed here:

http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~leyffer/solvers.html

In order to obtain a copy of FilterSQP, please contact the above
authors.

2. Putting the source code into the expected place:

Once you have source code, please put the source files into a
subdirectory call 'source' in this directory, so that 'source/src'
contains the source files (such as filter.f)

3. Applying the patches:

In order to use FilterSQP with Bonmin, three files have to be changed
slightly.  For this, please run the following command in this current
directory:

patch -p0 < filtersqp.patch

4. Configuration

Once you have the source code in source/src with the required patches,
you need to (re)run the configure script in the project's base
directory.
